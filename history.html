        <div id="box1">"Halloween has a rich history that spans centuries, evolving from ancient festivals to the popular holiday we know today. Its origins can be traced to the *Celtic festival of Samhain*, celebrated on October 31st. Samhain marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time when the Celts believed the boundary between the living and the dead was thinnest. They thought spirits of the dead could return to earth, so they lit bonfires and wore costumes to ward off harmful ghosts.

            With the spread of Christianity, *All Saints' Day* (also called All Hallowsâ€™s Day) was established by the Catholic Church on November 1st to honor saints and martyrs. The evening before, *All Hallows' Eve*, became a time to prepare for the holy day. Over time, All Hallows' Eve became Halloween.
            
            *In medieval Europe, it was common for poor people to go "souling," where they would beg for food in exchange for prayers for the dead. This practice evolved into **trick-or-treating*. By the 19th century, as Irish and Scottish immigrants brought their Halloween traditions to North America, the holiday transformed into a more secular celebration, incorporating elements like ghost stories, jack-o'-lanterns (originally made from turnips in Europe), and costumes.
            
            In the 20th century, Halloween became commercialized in the United States, with the rise of candy, decorations, and elaborate costumes, making it a significant part of American culture.
            
            Today, Halloween is celebrated worldwide, blending ancient customs with modern-day fun. It continues to evolve, with traditions like haunted houses, pumpkin carving, and costume parties being central elements of the holiday."</div>
